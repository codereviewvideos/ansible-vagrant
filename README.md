# WIP

## Are you looking to get started with the Symfony 2 framework, but aren't sure how to start?

"Getting to the bit where I can type some code" is probably the biggest barrier to entry in actually getting started for a beginner. 

I know that's how I felt when I started with Symfony 2. 

If only there were some easy way to spin up a server... properly. 

Well...

## Good News Everyone

Now you can spin up a working Symfony 2 site, running on nginx server, with a pre-configured MySQL database already plugged in and ready to start. 

Installation is done with just one command - `vagrant up`. 

Ok, you may need to install three pieces of software - but it's honestly pretty much just next > next > next. 

Then, just fire up your IDE or editor of choice, and away you go. 

## Installation Options

I've put together a set of what I believe to be the most requested builds: 

* Symfony 2 web site with demo project
* Symfony 2 web site, but ready for your existing project
* Symfony 2 RESTful API starter / reference project

From these three points, your development with Symfony 2 can begin. 

### Symfony 2 web site with demo project



### Symfony 2 web site, but ready for your existing project



### Symfony 2 RESTful API starter / reference project
